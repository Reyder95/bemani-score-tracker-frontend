# bemani-score-tracker-frontend
A website where bemani players may keep organized track of their own scores and goals. (Front end)

## What Games Will Be Supported? 
Currently we only plan to support active Bemani titles, though this might change in the future. With that said, we're currently focusing on more accessible titles, but will branch out if there is a demand.

  - SOUND VOLTEX (First Support)
  - Beatmania IIDX (Following Up)
  - DanceDanceRevolution (Following Up)

## Post and Keep Track of Scores
Within the website you will be able to post scores that you've gotten on various songs and difficulties, and keep track of how well you're doing compared to yourself. You will end up building scoreboards for every song you play, and thus allowing you to really see your performance improvement. Prior to this players were just using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel in order to keep track of their scores, which ended up being very sloppy (I was one of these people). With this website, everything is displayed neatly and all you have to do is write down your play specifics (like Score, Clear Type, Clear %, and so forth).

Example: You post 25 scores on iLLness LiLin level 20. They all range from 8.7 million up to 9.2 million. Now you play it again, get a really impressive score, and decide to upload that. You can see, out of 25 uploaded scores this was the best. 

Example 2: You post 25 scores on Lachryma level 20, and you play another time. You get a pretty decent score, and go to upload it to the website. Now you can see you placed 12th out of your now 26 scores on Lachryma 20. This is good for identifying exactly how you are playing at this moment. You know if you placed 26th out of your 26 plays, you know that's definitely not good and you're playing nowhere near your best.
