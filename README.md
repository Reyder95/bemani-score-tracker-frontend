# bemani-score-tracker-frontend
A website where bemani players may keep organized track of their own scores and goals. (Front end)

### What Games Will Be Supported? 
Currently we only plan to support active Bemani titles, though this might change in the future. With that said, we're currently focusing on more accessible titles, but will branch out if there is a demand.

  - SOUND VOLTEX (First Support)
  - Beatmania IIDX (Following Up)
  - DanceDanceRevolution (Following Up)
  
  ### Due to difficulties with the site, supporting more than SOUND VOLTEX may prove to be a challenge, so unless we can get a team that can help maintain a DB for another game, we will just keep this sound voltex related.
  
### Adding Song To Your Profile
You are able to add songs to your profile to begin placing scores on them. This system also allows you to build collections of songs, so you can organize your song list more neatly. This allows you to give a bit of character to yourself to show people what songs you enjoy playing, or what songs you play at all.

- Example: You want to start going for a lot of song clears to diversify what kinds of charts you play. You decide to make a collection called "Song Clears". You then begin scouting the global song list for songs you'd like to clear, and begin adding them to the collection. Soon enough you have a good 45 songs in the collection that you're ready to place clears on. You then have another collection called "Goal Songs Cleared" where you place songs that you've successfully cleared, and remove them from the "Song Clears" collection.

### Post and Keep Track of Scores
Within the website you will be able to post scores that you've gotten on various songs and difficulties, and keep track of how well you're doing compared to yourself. You will end up building scoreboards for every song you play, and thus allowing you to really see your performance improvement. Prior to this players were just using Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel in order to keep track of their scores, which ended up being very sloppy (I was one of these people). With this website, everything is displayed neatly and all you have to do is write down your play specifics (like Score, Clear Type, Clear %, and so forth).

- Example: You post 25 scores on iLLness LiLin level 20. They all range from 8.7 million up to 9.2 million. Now you play it again, get a really impressive score, and decide to upload that. You can see, out of 25 uploaded scores this was the best. 

- Example 2: You post 25 scores on Lachryma level 20, and you play another time. You get a pretty decent score, and go to upload it to the website. Now you can see you placed 12th out of your now 26 scores on Lachryma 20. This is good for identifying exactly how you are playing at this moment. You know if you placed 26th out of your 26 plays, you know that's definitely not good and you're playing nowhere near your best.

### Post Goals and Document Your Progress Towards Completing Them
Using this website, you will be able to use our Goal Creator. What this will allow you to do is easily create a goal that you want to work towards, like Ultimate Chaining a specific chart, Clearing a specific chart, or something general like "Clear All Level 19s". There will be a progress bar towards the completion of the goal, and you can see your own improvement right before your eyes. I think this is something lacking in a majority of games or hobbies, and I think this would help someone improve greatly.

- Example: You're moving into level 19s, and want to start a 19 hunt, so you Select "Goal Type: Clear" then select all the level 19s you'd like to clear. Then, as you post scores that are clears of the given charts, it will check those off.

### View Other People's Scores / Progress and Even Suggest Songs For Others To Play
If you know someone, you will be able to search for them in the database. Their profile will come up with all their statistics. From here you can look at their goal list and their song list. You can also suggest songs for this user to play, or perhaps give people scores to beat. (this is just an idea, but I feel it could be a interesting one).
